Changelog
=========

1.5.5 (2012-08-23)
------------------

* Improve how form parameters are encoded in the URL when redirecting
  to the login form. This prevent unwanted errors when parameters are
  binary like data.

1.5.4 (2012-01-13)
------------------

* Add an option 'Redirect to path', that compute the redirect URL
  using the same hostname and protocol than the login form. This is
  useful if you want to redirect logged in people to an other virtual
  host.

* Use ACTUAL_URL instead of URL to find the redirect URL. This is
  useful to prevent some miscalculation in Zope URL computations.

------------------

* Tableless login form with Cancel button.
