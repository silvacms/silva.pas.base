Installing SilvaPAS
=============================

SilvaPAS needs (besides Silva) four Zope Products to
work for its Radius support:

* PluggableAuthService
* PluginRegistry - needed by PluggableAuthService
* GenericSetup - needed by PluggableAuthService

Below are detailed instructions for the installation of the individual
products.

PluggableAuthService (1.5-final)
--------------------------------

http://www.zope.org/Products/PluggableAuthService

Comment out everything in importexport.zcml as this depends on GenericSetup.

PluginRegistry (1.1.2-final)
----------------------------

http://www.zope.org/Products/PluginRegistry

After unpacking, rename to 'PluginRegistry'

GenericSetup (1.3 final)
------------------------
